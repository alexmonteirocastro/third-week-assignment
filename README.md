## Week 3 - Homework assignment

This weeks homework assignment consisted in creating a KOA based RESTful API that executes CRUD operations in a dataset of articles. 

### Important aspects

The data set used was not content from a database, and it was not an array either. 
The data set of articles was being stored in a JavaScript map. This was especially interesting given that with maps, CRUD operations become much more intuitive. 

### Running the application

Use 

```
npm run server
```
